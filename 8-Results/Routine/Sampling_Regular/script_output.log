Sampling 4 chains, 476 divergences ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100% 0:00:00 / 8:42:14
Sampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 500 draw iterations (4_000 + 2_000 draws total) took 31334 seconds.
There were 476 divergences after tuning. Increase `target_accept` or reparameterize.
The rhat statistic is larger than 1.01 for some parameters. This indicates problems during sampling. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08008 for details
The effective sample size per chain is smaller than 100 for some parameters.  A higher number is needed for reliable rhat and ess computation. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08008 for details
